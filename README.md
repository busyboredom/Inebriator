The Inebriator is a simple drink mixing machine which allows the user to
specify the % ABV of a drink. Please note that a custom pump callibration
curve will need to be made for whatever pumps you use. 

Included is the code for both a rapsberry pi and an Arduino. If you choose to
use a raspberry pi, you will have the option of a CLI.

In either case, you will need:

-- Two drinks.

-- Two pumps.

-- MOSFETs to drive the pumps.

-- An LCD.

-- A potentiometer.

-- A button.

-- Tubing.
